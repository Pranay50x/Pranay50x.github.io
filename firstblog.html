        <div>Hello there, my name is <b>Pranay</b> and am a sophomore at <a href="https://msrit.edu" target="_blank"><i>MS Ramaiah Institute of Technology</i></a>, Bangalore, India. <br>
            I am currently pursuing my Bachelors in Engineering in <b>Computers Science and Engineering with specilisation in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.</b>
        </div>
    <div>
     I have been passionate about Computers since high school and i ended up choosing this very domain as my career path.<br>
     The field of Computers has made our life very efficient needless to say. But in today's world the growth <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> has been immense.<br>  
    </div>
    <div>
     The enthusiasm about <b>Computers</b> has been always there for me. I started initially by learning the basics in school and slowly was put into <b>Web Development, and Programming. </b><br>
      I began slowly learning more on <b title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</b>. Later gradually learning programming languages such as <b>Java and C plus plus</b>. 
    </div>
    <div>
     Then came 11th grade where most of the students like me are thrown into a world of competition. I also ended up being one of the large members in the crowd.<br>
     Everyone prepared for the <b>JEE</b> which is the <i>Joint Entrance Examination</i> one of the toughest exams to get into the <b title="Indian Institute of Technology">IITs</b> and <b title="National Institute of Technology">NITs</b>. <br>
     They are the most prestigious institutions in India. But I was not so capable for it so I did not take it up. I knew I wanted to do Engineering so I did prepare for<br>
     the state level Entrance exam which is the <b>Karanataka Common Entrance Test</b>.<br>
        <div>
            After two years of vigorous training I ended up picking <b>MS Ramaiah Institute of Technology</b><br>
            Its regarded as one of the top most institutes one can get through the KCET exam. So here I am today as an Engineering student at <b title="MS Ramaiah Institute of Technology">MSRIT</b>.<br>
            Hope it was fun reading the blog have a good day folks!
